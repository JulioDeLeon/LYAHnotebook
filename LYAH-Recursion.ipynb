    "#### Things to remember while using recursion in Haskell:\n",
    "Haskell use lazy-evaluation to implement recursion. This model for recursion in different from languages that are eagerly evaluated (All imparative languages and some functional languages are eagerly evaluated). In the case of impartive language, almost all the time, when a function is recursively called, memory is added to the stack. This could create issues for deep recursive calls. Where most functional language will use tail-call optimization to accomdate this. Tail-call optimaztion is a feature of a language which will avoid new stack allocation when making a recursive call.\n",
    " \n",
    "Haskell does NOT use tail-call optimization due to lazy-evaluation. This means that a 'Thunk' is created, a promise of a return of a value. However a 'Thunk' is not cost free. If you are interested in how much memory a 'Thunk' can take, look here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13982863/how-much-memory-does-a-thunk-use. \n",
